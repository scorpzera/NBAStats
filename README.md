For purposes of studying and learning, I will start making some data projects and post it here as my portfolio. 

This is my first project, and as I am a sports enthusiastic, nothing better than start doing it in a subject I like. 

This project is based on web scraping, as I collect data I want from the web, specifically from https://www.basketball-reference.com.
